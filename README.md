Concept
----------
Nearby Shops is a Hyperlocal Shopping platform where a customer can buy directly from the shops available in his/her local area and get their orders delivered to their home or just pick the order up from the shop. 

In the new emerging world, customers are getting tired of going outside the home to shop every day. They would much prefer to simply place an order and have the products delivered to their home the same day. 

Conventional e-commerce has issues ... the delivery takes a long time and it's more difficult to trust unknown vendors whom you cannot see and meet. Hyperlocal e-commerce solves these issues because delivery is faster and customers can reach out to the vendors easily. 

Nearby Shops can also be used as a food Delivery platform where restaurants can use it to deliver food. 

Nearby Shops implements Alibaba's New Offline-to-Online Concept, where customers discover products online and then pick those products up from physical stores.

Tech Stack and app Architecture
--------------------------------

Uses Android Jetpack and Google’s Recommended Architecture Patterns - Migration to MVVM is planned

Written in both Java and Kotlin : Migration to kotlin is planned and will be coming in near future

Built using Butterknife, Retrofit, Ok-HTTP, Picasso, Dagger, and the Mapbox Android SDK

Software is made using the modular View-Holder Pattern which makes the UI blocks modular, easy to reuse, modify and understand.

The app uses Single Activity Architecture, where most of the screens are implemented as fragments and there are only 2-3 activities in the entire project.

The project has 3 Android apps. One app each for the end-user, shop-owner and adminstrator. There is also a JSON-based REST API on the backend. The source for the REST API is provided. 





Features and Highlights
----------------------------

Mobile Based - Multi-Vendor Platform where customers can send orders to multiple shops / restaurants

Integrations for Sending SMS-OTP, E-mail and Push Notifications are available

Order Tracking, with live status updates for customers using e-mail, SMS and push notifications

Rating and Reviews for items and shops

Home delivery and pick-up from the shop (Online-to-Offline) Shopping Concept is Supported

Location based filtering is available, which means that customers will see only those shops which can deliver to their address -- other shops will be filtered out. 

Vendors / shop-owners can track orders through orders inventory and update the order progress !

By adding delivery staff, shop-owners can deliver orders by themselves. Shared delivery logistics will also be available in future releases of Nearby Shops. 

Billing and payments are supported. Shop-owners are billed according to the number of orders they deliver successfully. And Service Providers (Market Owners) can collect payments from the shop-owners. 

Commercial Use - This is not just a hobby project and you can actually use it to setup your business and earn some real money.

Development Instructions
-------------------------

If you're a developer looking to work on the source code follow these instructions to start developing !

```js
git clone https://github.com/SumeetMoray/Nearby-Shops-End-User-Android-app.git
```

You should now open the project with the latest version of Android Studio. The project will not compile unless you add the following property in the local.properties file. 

This project uses mapbox android sdk which requires mapbox style url. To add the style url in the project open this project in the android studio and add the Mapbox Style URL in the local.properties file. 

It is okay if you don't have an actual Mapbox style url. In that case, just put some dummy text in place of the url. 

```js
mapbox_style_url="your-mapbox-style-url"
```
